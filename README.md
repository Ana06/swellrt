# SwellRT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/P2Pvalue/swellrt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/P2Pvalue/swellrt)

SwellRT is a **real-time storage platform**. This project includes the server runtime and the JavaScript client for Web applications.

SwellRT enables **real-time collaboration** in your Web applications: multiple users can share and edit JavaScript objects in real-time with transparent conflict resolution (*eventual consistency*). Changes are distributed in real-time to any user or App instance using a shared object.

Objects are stored in the server and can be query using the API.

SwellRT provides also **out-of-the-box collaborative rich-text editing** for Web applications (as Google DocsÂ® or Etherpad) through an extensible **text editor Web component and API**.

## NOTICE

This README.md file refers only to **Alpha** source code of SwellRT. 

A new SwellRT **Beta** code is in ongoing development. For more information check out [README_BETA.md](README_BETA.md)

The source code of both versions lives together in this same Git repo/branch.  

You may find comprehensive documentation [in the project Wiki](https://github.com/P2Pvalue/swellrt/wiki).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you the latest version of the server up and running in your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK 8](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)
- [MongoDB 2.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Install and run

1. Download latest binary release (tar or zip) from [GitHub](https://github.com/P2Pvalue/swellrt/releases/latest).

2. Extract server binary files with ``tar zxvf swellrt-bin-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`` .

3. Start the server from the swellrt folder 
   
   Linux:
    ```
    cd swellrt 
    ./run-server.sh
    ``` 
    
    Windows:    
	 ```
	 cd swellrt
	 run-server.bat
	 ```
  
   Check out server status in ``http://demo.swellrt.org/test/``.
   Log in with user name 'test' and password 'test'.

### Docker

A docker image of the latest release of SwellRT is provided at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/p2pvalue/swellrt/):

```sh
$ docker pull p2pvalue/swellrt
```

This image doesn't include a MongoDB server. To pass connection data for a MongoDB instance to the container pass following environment variables to the container:

```sh
$ docker run -e MONGODB_HOST=<host> -e MONGODB_PORT=<port> -e MONGODB_DB=<db name> -p 9898:9898 -h swellrt -d p2pvalue/swellrt
```

Some SwellRT's configuration and data files must be stored out of the Docker container to avoid losing data when the image is updated. Map these folders in your host machine use following parameters:

```sh
$ docker run -v <host machine folder>:<docker image folder>  -p 9898:9898 -h swellrt -d p2pvalue/swellrt
```

List of docker's image folders that should be placed outside the container (in your host machine):

- `/usr/local/swellrt/config` Folder storing all config files. See documentation for details.
- `/usr/local/swellrt/log` Folder storing server log.
- `/usr/local/swellrt/sessions` Folder storing Web sessions.
- `/usr/local/swellrt/avatars` Folder storing user's avatar.
- `/usr/local/swellrt/attachments` Folder storing attachment files (when MongoDB is not used as attachment storage).


### Server configuration

Default configuration is provided in the file [reference.conf](https://github.com/P2Pvalue/swellrt/blob/master/wave/config/reference.conf).
To overwrite a property, do create a new file named `application.config` in the config folder and put there the property with the new value.

## Contributing

### Getting the source

Clone the SwellRT source code from the GitHub repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/P2Pvalue/swellrt
```

### Setup Dev

SwellRT can be setup for eclipse and intellij IDE's.

Running `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea` will generate all project files needed.
In a situation where dependencies have changed or project structure has changed
run `./gradlew cleanEclipse` or `./gradlew cleanIdea` depending on your IDE.


### Gradle Tasks

Java 8 and Gradle 2.8+ are required to build the project.

Gradle tasks can be run by:

```sh
$ ./gradlew [task name]
```

Test Tasks:

- **test**: runs the standard unit tests.
- **testMongo**: runs the mongodb tests.
- **testLarge**: runs the more lengthy test cases.
- **testAll**: runs all the above tests.

Compile Tasks:

- **generateMessages**: Generates the message source files from the .st sources.
- **generateGXP**: Compiles sources from the gxp files.
- **compileJava**: Compiles all java sources.
- **compileJsWebDev**: Compiles all the Gwt sources for development (Javascript Web client).
- **compileJsWeb**: Compiles all the Gwt sources (Javascript Web client).


Run Tasks:

- **run**: runs the server with the default parameters and generate dev version of the JS library.

- **gwtDev**: runs the [gwt super development mode](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html) to debug the JS client  library. Super dev mode only works for one target browser, according to settings in `SwellRTDev.gwt.xml`.

Distribution Tasks:

- **jar**: builds jar file for the project.
- **sourcesJar**: builds a source jar file for each project.
- **createDist**: builds the zip and tar file for bin and source.
- **createDistBin**: builds the zip for distribution.
- **createDistBinZip**: builds the zip for distribution.
- **createDistBinTar**: builds the tar for distribution.
- **createDistSource**: builds the zip and tar file for distributing the source.
- **createDistSourceZip**: builds the zip for distributing the source.
- **createDistSourceTar**: builds the tar for distributing the source.


### Debugging server

Server can be debugged launching the *run* gradle task with following parameters:

```./gradlew run --debug-jvm```

The Java process will get suspended for the remote debugger connection on the port 5005.

### Build

To build the client and server:

```sh
$ ./gradlew jar
```

It will be created in `wave/build/libs/wave-*version*.jar`.

The sources can also be packaged into a jar by doing:

 ```sh
 $ ./gradlew sourcesJar
 ```

This will create a *project name*-sources.jar in each projects build/libs directory.

Note:

- if pst-*version*.jar is unable to be found run `./gradlew pst:jar` then retry.
- if a jar is unable to be unzipped with wave:extractApi then delete the jar from your cache and try again.
    You may need to restart.

Take a look at the reference.conf to learn about configuration and possible/default values.

The server can be started (on Linux/MacOS) by running `./run-server.sh` or on Windows by running `run-server.bat`. *Note: must be cd'ed into the root directory*.

Or, you can run the server from the compiled classes with Gradle: `gradle run`.

The web client will be accessible by default at <http://localhost:9898/>.
