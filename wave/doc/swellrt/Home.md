## SwellRT

SwellRT is an open source **backend-as-a-service**. It allows to develop Web apps quickly by providing a set of common backend features:

* Real-time storage
* User management
* Auth
* Event based integration

**Federation**

SwellRT supports federation of servers based on matrix.org open protocol.

**Clients**

Currently, only a Javascript client for Web applications is provided. But native versions for Android and iOS could be also provided.

**Storage**

With SwellRT multiple users can manipulate the same data object in real-time with transparent conflict resolution. Changes are distributed in real-time to every user connected at the same time to that object.

Concurrency control and storage are based on Apache Wave Operational Transformation system. It ensures eventual consistency of shared data.
